  <p>Sungudi sarees, known for their vibrant, dotted patterns, are a traditional handloom fabric from Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India. They are created using a tie-and-dye technique, where small wooden blocks create patterns on the fabric before dyeing, resulting in intricate dotted designs. The Saurashtrians, who migrated to South India around the 8th to 11th century and settled in Madurai, introduced this technique.</p>
